Assignment: CS 410 a3 - Web Server with Dynamic Content

Compiling:
- Type 'make' to get the files all set up
- To run the web server, type "./webserv port-number [&]"
- Type 'make clean' to remove the binary executable file
- To kill the web server if it was backgrounded, type "fg" and then ctrl+c

Teammates:
- Justina Choi (justinac@bu.edu)
- Mahir Gulrajani (mahirkg@bu.edu)

Notes & Assumptions:
- The .cgi files will have something similar to echo/print "Content-type: text/html"
- It works for all the test cases listed on the assignment page
- You need to do 'chmod 755 test.cgi' on a cgi file to get the server to access it
- To use the web browser to call my-histogram, type in "my-histogram.pl?filename?pattern1?pattern2?pattern3?pattern4?pattern5"
  as the request. Of course, you can vary the number of patterns anywhere from 1 to 5
- The webserver calls my-histogram which outputs the data in a file called output.dat, then it calls
  plot.cgi which reads in from output.dat and creates an image file. Then it cats the image file to the
  browser.
